# SPOLVERRO
### A method for analyzing single-spot analysis referenced to spectral imaging and its application in the diagnostic of Cultural Heritage.

**SPOLVERRO** (like [spolvero](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spolvero) but with two 'r') is a set of tools used for analyzing **S**pectral data with **P**CA **O**n pictorial **L**ayers represented as **V**ectors **E**xtracted from **R**asters images **R**eferenced **O**nsite.

In this repository you can find some utilities and tutorial for analyzing data acquired with single-spot techniques referenced over spectral imaging cubes.

This work was specifically design for applications in diagnostic of Cultural Heritage, here we present what concer the implementation of the method using open-source Python libraries.
